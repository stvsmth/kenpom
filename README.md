# KenPom scraper üèÄ

![tests](https://github.com/stvsmth/kenpom/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

A little bit of Python to scrape the front page of the wonderfully useful
[KenPom](https://kenpom.com) site for NCAA basketball statistics. This tool assumes
you are comfortable on the command-line and basic Python tooling like `pip`. It's
not really useful unless you like tinkering with Python.

Why scrape? Well, if your team rarely haunts the top 25 and/or your curious how your
team ranks against other non-ranked teams, KenPom is one way to compare relative
strengths.

This requires Python 3.8 or greater.

## Installation

This is tool primarily uses [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). While not
required, using virtual environments is almost always the smart thing to do. Also, we
use some pre-commit hooks to keep things formatted nicely and avoid some silly mistakes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stvsmth/kenpom.git
python3 -m venv kenpom
cd kenpom && source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
pytest tests
```

## Usage

You can pass filtering options in via command-line arguments or as prompted. We'll
filter on conference(s), school name(s), or the top `n` schools. With no input we
simply print the top 25 teams. School codes and conference names must match exactly.
School names will match on any string. See the examples below for the finer points.

### Search order precedence
If any school code (KU, UK, OKLA, etc) is present, then the entire search will
proceed as a code search. Conference searches are executed with the same rules: if any
conference is supplied, we'll perform a conference search.

Only after checking for school code(s) and conference code(s) will we match on school
name(s).

You will probably forget this and never even care. But if your search returns more or
fewer schools than you were expecting, this is probably why.

### Examples

#### Interactive mode

All the following examples will work in interactive mode as well.

To leave interactive mode type `q`, `quit`, or `exit`. For clarity we'll remove the
`Data through` footer for the remaining examples.

    (kenpom) $ python kenpom.py
    Top `n`, code(s), conference(s), or schools(s) [25]: 5

          Kansas     KU     1   23-3  B12
